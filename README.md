### :sos: How to get help

Learning how to think as a web developer is learning how to be an expert in problem solving. So whenever you get stuck start with step 1 and continue until problem solved.

1. Google! In English, type in the error message if there is one, search within the language you're using (ie CSS, JavaScript etc).
2. Ask your code buddies.
3. Ask your fellow students in Slack.
4. Ask David. Please note: we are part of a sharing community - share the answer with your fellows.

### :boom: Success!

After completing this assignment, you should be getting fairly used to the core principles of the JavaScript language such as variables, types, conditional statement and functions, and you should be getting a little more comfortable with more advanced topics such as arrays and objects, and the functions which can be used to modify or iterate on them. The next assignment will help you build on this even more.

### :runner: Stretch Goals

Done with the main task? Here's some ideas for things to continue with:

- Read about [JavaScript Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) and make a copy of 5-objects.html called 5-classes.html and try to convert all of the tasks in there to use a Person and Dog class.
- Build upon the Person class; write a function in the Person class which prints the name and age of the person when invoked.
